# Seven more languages in seven weeks

Code generated from meetings of [the London Computation
Club](http://london.computation.club) as we study [Seven more languages
in seven weeks](https://pragprog.com/book/7lang/seven-more-languages-in-seven-weeks)

* Lua
  * [Day 1](./lua/day_1) - just the exercises
  * [Day 2](./lua/day_2) - scratch pad files from working through the text,
    exercies, and some [notes](./lua/day_2/notes.md) on how I got on
  * [Day 3](./lua/day_3) - scratch pad files from working through the text,
    exercies, and some [notes](./lua/day_3/notes.md) on how I got on
* Factor
  * [Day 1](./factor/day_1) - [notes](./factor/day_1/notes,md) and the
    exercises.
  * [Day 2](./factor/day_2) - [notes](./factor/day_2/notes,md) and the
    examples / exercises described in the chapter.
  * [Day 3](./factor/day_3) - [notes](./factor/day_3/notes,md) and the
    examples described in the chapter (I didn't do the exercises (yet)).
* Elm
  * [Day 1](./elm/day_1) - [notes](./elm/day_1/notes,md) only, no exercises
    (yet)
  * [Day 2](./elm/day_2) - [notes](./elm/day_2/notes.md) only. We went
    off book for this chapter because the book covered remvoed features
    of Elm so while I did read and make notes on the book as well as the
    alternate reading material, I didn't bother with the book exercises.
  * [Day 3](./elm/day_3) - [notes](./elm/day_3/notes.md) only. As with
    Day 2, we went off book.  These notes are on the book, but I didn't
    do the exercises.
* Elixir
  * [Day 1](./elixir/day_1) - [notes](./elixir/day_1/notes.md) and scratch pad
    files form working through the text.
