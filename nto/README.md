# New Turing Omnibus

Code generated from meetings of [the London Computation
Club](http://london.computation.club) as we study [The New Turing
Omnibus](http://us.macmillan.com/thenewturingomnibus/akdewdney/9780805071665)

* [chapter 9](./mandel-jack) - JACK implementation of the mandelbrot algorithm
  (we built JACK during our study of [The Elements of Computing
  Systems](http://www.nand2tetris.org/).  (spoiler: it doesn't work) and a ruby
  implementation that can generate ascii or bitmap output.
* [chapter 44](./conway) - JS implementation of conway's game of life, I used
  this as an example to lead the group through a ["code
  retreat"](http://coderetreat.org/) style event.
